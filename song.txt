Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
